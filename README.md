# A Memory-Efficient Doubly Linked List

This is an implementation of a doubly linked list using a memory-efficient approach.

# Why is it memory-efficient?

- In a conventional implementation, each node stores a pointer to the next item and a pointer to the previous item.
This means every node in a typical doubly linked list contains:
  - The data
  - A pointer to the next node
  - A pointer to the previous node
- In a memory-efficient implementation, we only store the XOR of the previous and next pointers, using the bitwise exclusive OR (âŠ•) operation.
With this approach, we can still traverse the list in both directions using just one pointer field per node.

# Why does it work?
